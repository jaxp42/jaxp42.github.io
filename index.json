This one is the first of a series to draw some other fractals like the Dragon Curve or the Sierpinski Triangle.\nThese kinds of exercices are very useful for understanding recursion and for using turtle graphics to control the drawing position all time.\nYou can see the full code here.\nLevy\u0026rsquo;s C curve\u003e\rLevy\u0026rsquo;s C curve The Levy C curve is a self-similar fractal, which means that the element is exactly or very similar to a part of it. It starts with a line, and with this line have to interpret an isosceles triangle with the line as the hypotenuse and where the angles are 45¬∞, 90¬∞ and 45¬∞. Then we add the two missing segments and remove the original one. The next step is doing the same with the new lines formed. So we can interpret it as forming triangles using the segments of the previous triangles as a hypotenuse and then remove it.\nIn the next picture you can see the first steps: Another way to build the Levy C Curve, and the one that I used, is by joining two times the previous figure but rotating 90¬∞ before joining one with the other. With this approach you can see clearly the recursion.\nThe code\u003e\rThe code Once understood the way to build the Curve is time to identify the main parts of the program to make it happen.\nFirst steps\u003e\rFirst steps The first that came to mi mind is, where do I paint it? Of course because of the nature of the drawing is not possible to paint it line by line. It\u0026rsquo;s necesary to save the information of the draw somewhere. At first I though in a matrix but I didn\u0026rsquo;d want to be limited by the terminal size. Then I remembered my old times when I used to code very basic stuff with C++ and OpenGL. I really enjoyed to draw shapes with that.\nIn my case, to install OpenGL in Ubuntu was very easy:\n$ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev Now we can check OpenGL by importing it in our cpp file and then compiling. To import the library use:\n#include \u0026lt;GL/glut.h\u0026gt; And to compile programs with OpenGL I use the following command:\ngcc fileName.cpp -lglut -lGLU -lGL Now we have the paper to draw in (I needed to read the basic documentation of OpenGL because I didn\u0026rsquo;t remember barely nothing. üòÜ) So the other important part is where to save the position where we are drawing. For this the best option is to do a Turtle Graphic.\nDefining the turtle üê¢\u003e\rDefining the turtle üê¢ The turtle is used to know the exact position where we need to continue drawing. First I did an enum with all the possible directions, in this case:\nenum Direction{Right, Up, Left, Down}; Then I defined the turtle as a struct where I can save the coordinates and create the required methods to move it through the \u0026lsquo;paper\u0026rsquo;. With this know where we are all time and where we are heading.\nstruct Turtle { void advance(); void setPosition(double x, double y, Direction direction); void turnClockwise(); void turnCounterclockwise(); private: double turtleX, turtleY; Direction turtleDirection; }; You can check the full definition of the turtle methods here. void Turtle::advance(){ switch (turtleDirection){ case Right: glDrawLine(turtleX, turtleY, turtleX + LINE_SIZE, turtleY); turtleX += LINE_SIZE; break; case Up: glDrawLine(turtleX, turtleY, turtleX, turtleY + LINE_SIZE); turtleY += LINE_SIZE; break; case Left: glDrawLine(turtleX, turtleY, turtleX - LINE_SIZE, turtleY); turtleX -= LINE_SIZE; break; case Down: glDrawLine(turtleX, turtleY, turtleX, turtleY - LINE_SIZE); turtleY -= LINE_SIZE; break; } } void Turtle::setPosition(double x, double y, Direction direction){ turtleX = x; turtleY = y; turtleDirection = direction; } void Turtle::turnClockwise(){ int newDirection = (turtleDirection - 1 + 4) % 4; turtleDirection = Direction(newDirection); } void Turtle::turnCounterclockwise(){ int newDirection = (turtleDirection +1) % 4; turtleDirection = Direction(newDirection); } Drawing the lines\u003e\rDrawing the lines After some testing and after remembering how to use OpenGL I managed to create a method to draw a line. The line lenght has to be always the same so I declared it as a global constant.\nconst double LINE_SIZE = 0.0005; OpenGL works with 3d so it admits coordinates (x,y,z). But in this case z will be always 0 and will work with a cartesian plane with (x, y) coordinates. This way, to draw up just increment y by the LINE_SIZE constant, and decrement it to draw down. The same for drawing right (x + LINE_SIZE) and left (x - LINE_SIZE). The drawing method is:\nvoid glDrawLine(double fromX, double fromY, double toX, double toY){ printf(\u0026quot;LINE: %f, %f - %f, %f\\n\u0026quot;, fromX, fromY, toX, toY); glBegin( GL_LINES); glVertex3d( fromX, fromY, 0); glVertex3d( toX, toY, 0); glEnd(); } It\u0026rsquo;s the turtle the one who indicates this method the direction to paint through the turtle advance method.\nRecursion\u003e\rRecursion It\u0026rsquo;s easy to see the recursion in this exercise. If we need to build the C Curve of size n = 8 it\u0026rsquo;s the same as building a C Curve of size n = 7 and joining another C Curve of size n = 7 rotated and building a C Curve of size n = 7 is the same as build\u0026hellip; Well, we got it. The base case is the most basic element in the curve or n = 0.\nSo the recursive method to draw the full C Curve is:\nvoid drawCurve(int curveSize, Turtle \u0026amp;turtle){ if(curveSize == 0){ turtle.advance(); } else if(curveSize \u0026gt; 0){ drawCurve(curveSize - 1, turtle); turtle.turnClockwise(); drawCurve(curveSize - 1, turtle); turtle.turnCounterclockwise(); } } The only thing that remains is to ask the size of the curve to the user and it\u0026rsquo;s done. You can see the full code in the repository linked in the beginning of the post.\nHere are some examples of the C Curve with different sizes:\nSize 8: Size 11: Size 19: In this one I had to reduce the line size at 0.001 to fit the drawing in the screen.

Sometimes we need to work with different aggrupations in a set of elements, or just know the number of possible combinations to be able to do a loop through them. E.g., the number of different words that can be formed with n letters.\nFor this purpose we will use the following 3 group formation methods:\nVariations Permutations Combinations Variations\u003e\rVariations We can understand the variations of a set as a particular order of n elements of that set in a certain position. I.e. It\u0026rsquo;s not the same (a, b) than (b,a). They are both two variations of the same n elements of the set. Although the elements are the same, the position is not. In the variations the position is important. There are two types of variations:\nVariations without repetition. Variations with repetition. Variations without repetition.\u003e\rVariations without repetition. Having a finit and not empty set $S$ where $n = |S|$. And having the max number of elements in the variation $r \\in N$ and $1 \\le r \\le n$\nThere aren\u0026rsquo;t repeated elements from the set in each tuple. Two tuples are different if they haven\u0026rsquo;t got the same elements in the same positions. We can calculate the number of variations with the next formula: $$V_{n,r} = n!/(n - r)!$$\nE.g.\nIf we want to calculate the number of variations with 3 positions with the set of elements $S = \\langle{s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, s_{4}, s_{5}}\\rangle$ where $n = 5$, the solution is: $$V_{5,3} = 5!/(5 - 3)! = 60$$\nVariations with repetition.\u003e\rVariations with repetition. Having a finit and not empty set $S$ where $n = |S|$. Then having the number of positions to do the variations $r \\in N$.\nIn each tuple can be repeated elements of $S$. Two tuples are different while they don\u0026rsquo;t have the same elements in the same positions. We can calculate the number of variations with repetition with the formula: $$VR_{n,r} = n^{r}$$\nE.g.\nA good example for this one could be the binary numbers. How many numbers could we represent with 4 positions? Knowing the set of the binary numbers is just 0 and 1 then $n = 2$. We could solve it as follows: $$VR_{2,4} = 2^{4} = 16$$\nPermutations\u003e\rPermutations A permutation is the disposition of a specific order from a set of elements. It means that every time we change the order of those elements we are doing a permutation of the set.\nNow we can think about how many ways we have to order the same set. For this, we have two different scenarios:\nPermutations without repetition: In this case, the elements ordered can not be repeated. Permutations with repetition: The elements can appear more than one time in the order. Permutations without repetition.\u003e\rPermutations without repetition. Having a non empty and finit set $S$ and being $n = |S|$. We say the permutation without repetition, $P_{n}$, are the variations without repetition of $n$ elements taken $n$ by $n$. We calculate it with the following formula: $$P_{n} = n!$$\nE.g.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s supose we have the following set $S = \\langle{s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, s_{4}, s_{5}}\\rangle$ and $|S| = 5$. The number of total permutations in the set will be: $$P_{5} = 5! = 120$$\nPermutations with repetition.\u003e\rPermutations with repetition. Having a non empty and finit set $S = \\langle{s_{1}, s_{2}, \\dots, s_{n}}\\rangle$ and being $n = |S|$. Being the size of the permutation $p \\in N$ and $ p \\ge n$ and being the number of repetitions of each element of the set $r_{1}, r_{2}, \\dots, r_{n}$ where each $r_{i} \\in N \\cup \\langle{0}\\rangle$ and $r_{1} + r_{2} + \\dots + r_{n} = p$.\nIn each tuple the element $s_{j}$ must appear $r_{j}$ times. Two tupples are different if their elements are not equal. It\u0026rsquo;s calculated with the formula: $$PR_{p^{r_{1}, r_{2}, \\dots, r_{n}}} = p!/(r_{1}! * r_{2}! * \\dots * r_{n}!)$$\nE.g.\nConsider we have set $S = \\langle{s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}}\\rangle$ and $|S| = 3$. And we want to calculate the permutations repeating each element two times. Then $p = 2 + 2 + 2$. The total ammount of permutations is: $$PR_{6^{2, 2, 2}} = 6!/(2! * 2! * 2!) = 90$$\nCombinations\u003e\rCombinations A combination is a selection of n elements of a set in any order. Unlike the variations or the permutations, the order is not relevant in the combinations. I.e. (a,b) is the same that (b,a). We can separate them in two:\nCombinations without repetition. Combinations with repetition. Combinations without repetition.\u003e\rCombinations without repetition. Having a finit and not empty set $S$ where $n = |S|$. And having the max number of elements to combine $r \\in N$ and $1 \\le r \\le n$. We can use the formula: $$C_{n,r} = Binom(n,r)$$\nE.g.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s supose we want to calculate the combinations of 3 from a set $S = \\langle{s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, s_{4}, s_{5}, s_{6}}\\rangle$ where $n = 6$. It will be: $$C_{6,3} = Binom(6,3) = 6!/(3! * 3!) = 20$$\nCombinations with repetition.\u003e\rCombinations with repetition. Having a finit and not empty set $S$ where $n = |S|$. And having the max number of positions to combine the elements $r \\in N$.\nElements can repeate in each tuple Two tuples are the same if they have exactly the same elements. Although the elements are in different order. Then we can use the next formula: $$C_{n,r} = Binom(n + r - 1, r)$$\nE.g.\nIn this case we will calculate how many combinations can we do with 5 letters in 3 spaces. Remember that in this case the letters can be repeated. Then with $n = 5$ and $r = 3$: $$C_{5,3} = Binom(5 + 3 - 1, 3) = 7!/(4! * 3!) = 35$$\n","date":"9 February 2023","permalink":"/posts/theory/group-formations/","section":"Blog","summary":"Basic group formations ways.

I remembered that writing my thoughts and trying to explain the things I was studying was a very effective way to understand and reinforce what has been learned. So I decided to make another blog in a more proffesional way. After all, in the IT world you never stop studying.\nAbout me\u003e\rAbout me But let me introduce myself a little bit. My name is Jose. I\u0026rsquo;m a 30 years old developer based in Spain. I live in a small village with my dog Kira.

Sometimes, walking between the olive trees makes me think more clearly.\nAbout my hobbies, I read a lot, mostly historical or science fiction novels. Could be unnecessary to say that I spend much time researching and studying new IT things. Sometimes I try to encompass too many projects and activities so I try to manage my time the best I can.\nMy work\u003e\rMy work I\u0026rsquo;ve been working in IT since 2014, but not always as a software developer. I began working as an IT technician, where my job was mainly fixing computers and installing and configuring networks. It was at that time that I discover my passion for this world.\nAlways that I have a chance I have to thank my teachers from the IES Severo Ochoa in Elche and the IES Saladillo in Algeciras. Their professionalism and their awesome way to teach are one of the reasons why I chose this path.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been coding for 5 years ago and working as a full-stack developer for the last 3.\nWhat now?\u003e\rWhat now? The more I learn, the more I notice the little I know. So I decided to take another step in my studies. I began a college career in software engineering and I\u0026rsquo;m working on a personal project with React Native that I would like to have ready in the next months. Well, I think this is enought for a presentation. Although it\u0026rsquo;s a personal blog, I hope you could find some useful or curious information.\nThanks for reading. See you in the next post!!\n","date":"2 February 2023","permalink":"/posts/personal/presentation/","section":"Blog","summary":"This is my first post in the blog.
