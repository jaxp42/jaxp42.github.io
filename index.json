Why the blog?\u003e\rWhy the blog? I was going through my old GitHub repository from when I was a student, and I saw my old Hugo blog that I used to take notes. I remembered that writing my thoughts and trying to explain the things I was studying was a very effective way to understand and reinforce what has been learned. So I decided to make another blog in a more proffesional way. After all, in the IT world you never stop studying.\nAbout me\u003e\rAbout me But let me introduce myself a little bit. My name is Jose. I\u0026rsquo;m a 30 years old developer based in Spain. I live in a small village with my dog Kira. I moved here to avoid the mess of the big cities.\nWalking in nature is one of the things that relax me the most when I\u0026rsquo;m stressed or blocked by some problem. Sometimes, walking between the olive trees makes me think more clearly.\nAbout my hobbies, I read a lot, mostly historical or science fiction novels. Could be unnecessary to say that I spend much time researching and studying new IT things. Sometimes I try to encompass too many projects and activities so I try to manage my time the best I can.\nMy work\u003e\rMy work I\u0026rsquo;ve been working in IT since 2014, but not always as a software developer. I began working as an IT technician, where my job was mainly fixing computers and installing and configuring networks. It was at that time that I discover my passion for this world.\nAlways that I have a chance I have to thank my teachers from the IES Severo Ochoa in Elche and the IES Saladillo in Algeciras. Their professionalism and their awesome way to teach are one of the reasons why I chose this path.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been coding for 5 years ago and working as a full-stack developer for the last 3.\nWhat now?\u003e\rWhat now? The more I learn, the more I notice the little I know. So I decided to take another step in my studies. I began a college career in software engineering and I\u0026rsquo;m working on a personal project with React Native that I would like to have ready in the next months. Well, I think this is enought for a presentation. Although it\u0026rsquo;s a personal blog, I hope you could find some useful or curious information.\nThanks for reading. See you in the next post!!\n","date":"2 February 2023","permalink":"/posts/personal/presentation/","section":"Blog","summary":"This is my first post in the blog.
